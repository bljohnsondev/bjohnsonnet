# My Personal Website
This is the repository for the code for my personal website at [https://bjohnson.net](https://bjohnson.net). It was built using [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/) as my preferred IDE.  It uses the following technologies:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [open-props](https://open-props.style/)
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/)
